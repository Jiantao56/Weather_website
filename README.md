This is a simple weather website that tells you the current weather and related informations.
This project was made through Node.js and two api that I used for this project was the OpenWeatherMap api for weather forecast and mapbox's geocoding api.
As of right now the project is hosted in my heroku at https://jiantao-weather-app.herokuapp.com/
